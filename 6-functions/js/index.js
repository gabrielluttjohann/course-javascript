FUNCTIONS:

A function in JavaScript is a code block projected to perform a specific task.

It's like a little "Factory" where you make a road and he give you an output.

It can be thought of as "little-programs" designed to do a task that will contribute for all code

A JavaScript Function is performed when "Something" invokes it (call it).
